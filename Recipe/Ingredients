Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with cupcake liners.
Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.
In another bowl, cream butter and sugar until fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.
Add milk, lemon zest, and lemon juice to the wet ingredients, mixing until smooth.
Fold in the dry ingredients and raspberries gently.
Spoon batter into cupcake liners, filling each about 2/3 full.
